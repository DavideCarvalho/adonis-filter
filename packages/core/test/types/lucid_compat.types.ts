/**
 * Compile-time guard: a REAL `@adonisjs/lucid` query builder must be assignable
 * to {@link QueryBuilderLike}.
 *
 * This file is never executed and never bundled — `@adonisjs/lucid` is a
 * devDependency and nothing under `src/` imports it, so the package stays
 * framework-free where it counts. It exists only to be typechecked. Failing to
 * COMPILE is the failure signal.
 *
 * Why real Lucid instead of a hand-written stub: the bug this guards against was
 * originally chased with a transcribed stub of Lucid's `Where`/`WhereHas` types,
 * and the stub compiled clean while real Lucid did not. The stub was not a
 * faithful oracle, and there is no reason to think the next one would be. Only
 * Lucid's own `.d.ts` proves the seam.
 *
 * What broke, so the next reader doesn't re-derive it: `whereHas`'s relation
 * parameter must stay `any`. Lucid types it as `<Name extends
 * ExtractModelRelations<Model>>(relation: Name, ...)` — a union of the model's
 * literal relation names — and `string` is not assignable to that union under
 * the contravariant parameter check. Declaring `relation: string` makes every
 * real builder fail this file, and TS blames `where` (the first member it
 * tries), which is a red herring.
